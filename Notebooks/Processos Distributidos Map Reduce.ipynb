No. But, I mean, I don’t...\\n... Recognise this place. No, I know. Uh... OK. It’s just that, uh, this might be\\na shock to you. - It’s longer... - How long? Please. 57 years. What? That’s the\\nthing. You were out there for 57 years. You had drifted right through the core\\nsystems. And it’s reallyjust blind luck... ... That a deep-salvage team found\\nyou when they did. It’s one in a thousand, really. You’re damn lucky to be\\nalive, kiddo. You could be floating out there forever. You OK? Uh... Oh! You\\nOK? Oh! God! Nurse! Please! Someone get in here now! No! Now! Hold!\\nPlease! Hold her! Kill me! No! Bad dreams again? - You wantsomething to\\nhelp you sleep? - No. I’ve slept enough. Jonesy... Come here. Shh! It’s all\\nright. It’s all right now. It’s over. Hi. Sorry I’m late. Been running behind all\\nmorning. Is there any word about my daughter? Uh... I think we should worry\\nabout the hearing now. I read your deposition... ... And it’s great. If you stick\\nto that, we’ll be fine. There are gonna be a lot of heavyweights in there. Feds,\\nInterstellar Commerce Commission,... ... Colonial Administration, insurance\\ncompany guys. Do you have any news about my daughter? Well, we did come\\nup with some information. Why don’t we sit down? I was hoping to wait\\nuntil after the inquest. Uh... Amanda Ripley McClaren... Her married name, I\\nguess? Age 66. And that was at the time of her death,... ... which was two years\\nago. I’m real sorry. Amy... She was cremated... ... And interred at Westlake\\nRepository, in Wisconsin. No children mentioned. I promised her... ... That\\nI would be home for her birthday. Her eleventh birthday. Ohh... They’d like\\nto go back to this point about the override destruct order. I don’t understand\\nthis. We have been here for three and a half hours. How many different ways\\ndo you want the same story? Look at it from our perspective, please. Please?\\nYou admit to detonating the engines of, and thereby destroying, an M-Class\\nstar freighter. An expensive piece of hardware. 42 million in adjusted dollars.\\nThat’s minus payload, of course. The lifeboat’s flight recorder corroborates some\\nelements ofyour account. In that, for reasons unknown, the Nostromo set down\\non LV-426,... ... An unsurveyed planet at that time. That it resumed its course,\\nand was subsequently set for self-destruct by you... ... For reasons unknown.\\nNot for reasons unknown. I told you. We set down there on company orders\\nto get this thing, which destroyed my crew... ... And your expensive ship. The\\nanalysis team found no physical evidence ofthe creature you describe. Good!\\nThat’s because I blew it out of the goddamn air lock. Like I said. Are there any\\nspecies like this hostile organism on LV-426? No. It’s a rock. No indigenous\\n                                          1\\n'</span></li>\n",

It was not from\\nthere. Do you get it? We homed in on its beacon. And found something never\\nrecorded once in over 300 surveyed worlds. A creature that ”gestates... ...inside\\na living human host”. - Yes. These are your words. - ”And has concentrated\\nacid for blood. ” - That’s right. Look, I can see where this is going, but I’m\\ntelling you that... ...those things exist. - Thank you, Officer. That will be all.\\nPlease! You’re not listening. Kane - The crew member... Kane, who went into\\nthat ship, said he saw thousands of eggs. Thousands. Thank you. That will be\\nall. Goddamn it, that’s not all! If one ofthose things gets down here, that will\\nbe all! Then all this bullshit that you think is so important... You can kiss all\\nthat goodbye! It is the finding of this court of inquiry that... ... Warrant Officer\\nE Ripley,... ... NOC 14472,... ... Has acted with questionable judgment... ...\\nAnd is unfit to hold an ICC licence as a commercial flight officer. Said licence is\\nhereby suspended indefinitely. No criminal charges will be filed against you at\\nthis time, and you are released... ... On your own recognisance for a six-month\\nperiod of psychometric probation,... ... To include monthly review by an ICC\\npsychiatric technician. These proceedings are closed. That could have been...\\nBetter. - Look, I think... Ripley? - Van Leuwen. Why don’t you just check\\nout LV-426? Because I don’t have to. The people there have never complained\\nabout any hostile organism. What do you mean? What people? Terraformers.\\nPlanet engineers. They set up atmosphere processors to make the air breathable.\\nTakes decades. It’s what we call a Shake ’n’ Bake colony. How many are there?\\nHow many colonists? I don’t know. 60, maybe 70, families. Do you mind?\\nFamilies. Jesus! I’ll be down in maintenance, OK? - Al? - What? - Hey, Al. -\\nWhat? Remember you sent some wildcatters out past the alien range last week?\\nYeah. One ofthem’s on the horn. Says he’s on to something. Wants to know if\\nhis claim will be honoured. Why wouldn’t his claim be honoured? Because you\\nsent them on company orders, maybe? Christ! Some honch in a cushy office on\\nEarth says ”Go look at a grid reference”. We look. They don’t say why and I\\ndon’t ask. I don’t ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here. And\\nthe answer is always ”Don’t ask”. So what do I tell this guy? Tell him, as far\\nas I’m concerned, if he finds something, it is his. - Lydecker? - What? You kids\\nare not supposed to be on this level! Get out of here! You go in places we can’t\\nfit! So? That’s why I’m the best! Knock it off! If I catch you playing in the air\\nducts again, I’ll tan your hides. Mom, all the kids play... Annie, come and have\\na look at this, will ya? Folks, we have scored big this time. What is it, Dad?\\nI’m not sure. Let’s see ifwe can’t get a closer look at this thing. - Shouldn’t we\\ncall in? - Let’s wait till we know what to call it in as. That’s about as close\\nas we can get. Should we take a look inside? You kids stay inside. I mean it.\\nWe’ll be right back. - OK. - Bye. Timmy, they’ve been gone a long time. It’ll\\nbe OK. Dad knows what he’s doing. Mayday! Mayday! This is Alpha Kilo\\nTwo Four Niner calling Alpha Control! This is Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner!\\nHi, Ripley. This is Lieutenant Gorman of the Colonial Marine Corps... Ripley,\\nwe have to talk. We’ve lost contact with the colony on LV-426. I don’t believe\\nthis.

A what? - A xenomorph.\\nIt’s a bug hunt. What exactly are we dealing with here? Ripley? I’ll tell you\\nwhat I know. We set down on LV-426. A crew member was brought back with\\nsomething attached to his face,... ...some kind of parasite. We tried to get it\\noff. It wouldn’t come off. Later, it seemed to come off by itself and die. Kane\\nseemed fine. We were all having dinner. It must have laid something inside his\\nthroat, some sort of embryo. He started... Um, he...

Hey, I want to introduce you to a personal friend of mine.\\nThis is an M-41A pulse rifle, 10 millimetre,... ... with an over-and-under 30\\nmillimetre pump-action grenade launcher. Feel the weight. OK. What do I do?\\nPull it in tight here. - Right. - Lean into it. All right, now it will kick some.\\nWhen the counter reads zero here, you... - I press this up? - That’s right. Get\\nanother one in quick. Slap it in hard. - Right. - Now you’re ready to rock ’n’\\nroll. - What’s this? - The grenade launcher. I don’t think you want to mess\\nwith that. You started this. Show me everything. I can handle myself. Yeah, I\\nnoticed. How do you feel? All right, I guess. One hell of a hangover. - Look,\\nRipley, I just want... - Forget it. Excuse me. Shh, shh, shh. It’s OK. It’s OK.\\nNewt. Wake up. - What? - Be quiet. We’re in trouble. Agh! Move, Newt! Hey!\\nHelp! Help! Hicks! Say again, Bishop? You’ve got it into auto-refuel mode and\\nit’s sequencing right? That’s right. Good. Stay on it. Get back to me when\\nyou’ve activated the launch cycle. - He’s at the uplink tower. - Terrific. - Hicks!\\nHicks! - Help! Help! Hicks! Help us! Break the glass!

Shoot it out! - Hudson! - Jesus! Oh! Christ, kid, look out! -\\nOver there! - Yeah! - Ready? - Yeah! Hudson! Yeah, all clear. Nailed the\\nother one. It’s history, man. Jesus! Burke. It was Burke. I say we grease this\\nrat-fuck son of a bitch right now. It just doesn’t make any goddamn sense. He\\nfigured that he could get an alien back through quarantine... ... if one of us was\\nimpregnated. Whatever you call it. And then frozen for the trip home. Nobody\\nwould know about the embryos we were carrying,... ... Me and Newt. Wait,\\nnow. We’dall know. Yes. He could only do it by sabotaging certain freezers on\\nthe way home. Namely, yours. Then he could jettison the bodies and make up\\nany story he liked. Fuck! He’s dead. You’re dog meat, pal. This is so nuts. I\\nmean, listen... Listen to what you’re saying. It’s paranoid delusion. It’s really\\nsad. It’s pathetic. Burke, I don’t know which species is worse. They don’t fuck\\neach other over for a goddamn percentage. All right, we waste him. No offence.\\nNo! He’s got to go back... They cut the power. How can theycut the power?\\nThey’re animals! I want you two checking the corridors! Move! Gorman, watch\\nBurke. Newt, stay close. - I’ll go this side. - You do that, man. - Anything?\\n- There’s something. It’s inside the complex. You’re just reading me. No, it\\nain’t you. They’re inside the perimeter. They’re in here. Hudson, stay cool.\\nVasquez? Hudson may be right. - Get back, both ofyou. - The signal’s weird.\\nMust be some interference or something.
